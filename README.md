In this workshop, you will review how to work with the different Math object methods by building a Mathbot.

Step 1
In this workshop, you will review working with the different Math object methods by building a Mathbot. This Mathbot will log some math operations and messages to the console in efforts to teach you about JavaScript's Math object.

For this first step, start by creating a variable called botName and assign it the string value of "MathBot".

Then, create another variable called greeting and assign it the sentence "Hi there! My name is [botName goes here] and I am here to teach you about the Math object!". In place of the [botName goes here] placeholder, use the botName variable.

You are free to use template literals or string concatenation with the + operator to achieve this.

Finally, log the greeting variable to the console.
